# House Price Prediction in India

Welcome to the **House Price Prediction** project! In this repository, we explore advanced regression techniques to estimate house sale prices based on various features. From data preprocessing to model deployment, we'll take you through the entire journey.

## Problem Definition
Our primary objective is to develop a predictive model capable of estimating house sale prices with precision. We'll delve into a vast array of features and understand their impact on the target variable.

## Data
The dataset used in this project comes from a Kaggle competition titled "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques." It includes training and testing datasets, a data description file, and a sample submission file. You can access the dataset from the [Kaggle competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).

## Features
We consider the following features for prediction:
- **Number of Bedrooms**
- **Number of Bathrooms**
- **Floor Level**
- **House Condition (rated from 1 to 5)**
- **Number of Schools Nearby**

## Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
Our journey begins with data preparation and refinement. We handle missing data, apply label encoding, and perform one-hot encoding for categorical features. Feature engineering plays a crucial role in improving model performance.
